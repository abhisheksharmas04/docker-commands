Basic docker Commands:
	-> To display docker images in our machine: docker images
	-> Example: docker pull hello-world
	-> Docker is by default connected with docker hub

Download docker image:
	-> docker pull <image name> (By default we can pull public images )

Run docker image:
	-> docker run <image name>
	-> Example: docker run hello-world (we can use image name or image id to run the image)
	-> Whenever we run the image first docker will search image in the machine locally, if docker is enable to find then it will pull from docker hub

To remove the image:
	-> docker rmi <image-id/image-name> (rmi is the command which is used to remove the image)
	-> While delete image docker image must not be used by any container or stop container

To forcefully remove the image:
	-> docker rmi -f <image-id/image-name> (rmi -f is the command which is used to remove the image)
	-> To focre fully delete the image if it is linked with some container

To see the list of running containers
	-> docker ps (docker ps is the command is used to display running containers)

To see the list of all containers
	-> docker ps -a (docker ps -a is the command is used to display all containers)

To stop the docker container
	-> docker stop <container name>

To delete the docker container
	-> docker rm <container id>

To delete all stoped container and unused images:
	-> docker prune system -a
